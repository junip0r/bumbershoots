- Prevent blood rain from affecting pawns wearing umbrellas.
- Prevent Psychic Rain (Vanilla Events Expanded) from affecting pawns
  wearing umbrellas.
- Look into what happens when pawns are carried: are there are any events
  that should be handled, does the game still try to apply soaking wet, etc.
- Fix umbrellas rendering behind e.g. cat ears from Biotech. (Apparently
  this happens with hats in the vanilla game too.)
- Umbrellas should not count as clothing wrt nudism/nudity.
- Patch Path Finding Avoidance to not avoid weather if carrying the
  appropriate umbrella.
